/// There goes my darkest developer moment in my 5 year history. After going through about 50 resources how to wait for
/// `CGEvent.post` to complete yes it does some nasty Async stuff instead, probably queing somewhere in the dark macOS world
/// I just gave up and put briliant `Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval:)` because spending more than 3 weekends on almost-ready thing
/// is against my believes (even though I spend much more sometimes when I don't wanna achieve something in a non hacky way)
/// Anyway this whole project is just hack.
/// The best way to create this project would be class-dumping the `IDEKit`, `DVTKit` and `IDEFoundation`, Implement almost all the headers
/// Simulate `IDEApplication` run from there get the `EditorMenuDelegate` instance,
/// cache all the commands from `CommandManager` (I believe it loads on some calls in `EditorMenuDelegate`.)
/// Then there is `_activateMenuKeyBindingSetWithMenuDefinitionExtensionIdentifiers` and we are almost at it (this activates the reverse-dns stuff
/// we need to have loaded in order to call for instance com.apple.PegasusEditor(What the fuck).addDocumentation)
/// I believe the next steps would be to sacrifice unicorn and ride T-Rex to Cuppertino to get some secret framework or wtf.
///
/// I have gone this far and I believe it is just 3 steps to do this, but I don't really have capacity to continue with
/// Linking and running whole Xcode again just for this pet project. One day I might create separate branch which has IDEKit implementation
/// instead of this key-logging stuff.
///
/// If you, alongside with me, until this point have dreamed on working on Xcode at Apple one day, I am sorry to crush all your hopes and dreams. üò≠
/// Anyway here we go how this works.
///
/// # How it all works:
///
/// On input, we get our custom-defined `Shortcut` object which gives us the key and the modifiers
/// When we get those, because there is really no not-retarded first-party API to call shortcuts we create
/// CGEvent from the virtual key code. After the event is created, we iterate through the set of identifiers,
/// add them to the `keyPress` event. If you think we would just press the virtual button afterwards,you are a lot wrong.
/// This is where things get a lot funny and I really couldn't find any satisfying solution to the problem
/// (Because `CGEvent.post` is async :) Thanks Apple)
/// After that, we set the layout of keyboard on the context of our virtual `textView` to `USInternational-PC` because someone
/// could code in different language (I have a confession to make)
/// We need to wait some time for this to process, because it appears it's async operation too.
/// After that, we press finally the virtual keyCode with the modifiers and voila - the shortcut is called as a magic.
/// Because we are good people, we lift the button too.
/// We need to wait some time because the posting costs us some time as well. So we just wait.
/// After all the keys are lift up, we just set the keyboard to the one we fetched when the application was started in `ApplicationDelegate`
/// This process goes over and over as you are happy and press the buttons.
///
/// I feel really ashamed that I couldn't come up with some better solution than changing the keyboard layout and then waiting
/// To free my conscious I post here some of the resources I found:
