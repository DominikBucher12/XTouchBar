# XTouchBar
Making proper use of Touchbar inside Xcode. 


## TODO: 
- [ x ] Detect when Xcode is topmost application (focused), probably AppleScript is our friend :D 
- [ ] Create some intuitive icon-set for the shortcuts etc like add documentation... 
- [ ] Create collection for the buttons and assign to the buttons the given shortcuts.
- [ ] Figure out how to call shortcuts to desired Xcode features 
- [ ] Bonus, should go with previous point: Custom Xcode extensions.
- [ ] Impossible bonus -> Create someUI that user can drag'n'drop items into XTouchBar
- [ ] Clear up unused headers and refactor, and restructurize the app so it's readable.
