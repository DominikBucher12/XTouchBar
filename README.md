# XTouchBar
Making proper use of Touchbar inside Xcode.


## TODO:
- [ ] Finish the PropertyListParser (handle "<key>Text Key Bindings</key>" as well)
- [ ] Transform Strings received from the parser into our Shortcut data model
- [x] Detect when Xcode is topmost application (focused), probably AppleScript is our friend :D
- [ ] Create some mechanism that users can change to shortcuts on go.
- [ ] Create some intuitive icon-set for the shortcuts etc like add documentation...
- [ ] Create collection for the buttons and assign to the buttons the given shortcuts.
- [x] Figure out how to call shortcuts to desired Xcode features
- [ ] Bonus, should go with previous point: Custom Xcode extensions.
- [ ] Impossible bonus -> Create someUI that user can drag'n'drop items into XTouchBar
- [ ] Clear up unused headers and refactor, and restructurize the app so it's readable.
- [x] Add Swiftlint to format a style a bit :)
